# Drag and Drop Assignment

This is a simple web page that demonstrates the implementation of drag and drop functionality using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Instructions

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3. You should see two containers labeled "TODO" and "DONE" and a list of cards in the "TODO" container.
4. To drag and drop an item, click and hold on a card, then drag it to the desired container. Release the mouse button to drop the item.
5. When an item is dropped into the "DONE" container, a success message will be displayed.
6. To reset the containers and return the cards to their original state, click the "Reset" button at the bottom of the page.

## File Structure

The project includes the following files:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the structure and layout of the web page.
- `style.css`: The CSS file that defines the styles and layout of the page.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that handles the drag and drop functionality and other interactions.
